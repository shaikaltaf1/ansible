Use of Would:
Certainly! Here are more examples of how “would” is used to describe past habits or repeated actions:

Past Habits:
	v “Every winter, we would build a snowman in the backyard.”
	v “My grandmother would tell us stories before bedtime.”
Past Repeated Actions:
	v “When I was in college, I would study late into the night.”
	v “During summer vacations, we would visit the beach every weekend.”
Typical Behaviors:
	v “He would always bring flowers for his mother on her birthday.”--> means that it was a regular activity or tradition for them to hike in the mountains each spring season. The use of “would” indicates that this was a habitual action in the past.
	v “They would go hiking in the mountains every spring.”
Childhood Memories:
	v “As kids, we would ride our bikes around the neighborhood until it got dark.”
	v “We would spend hours playing board games on rainy days.”

During my childhood, I would play cricket daily VS I used to play cricket
“During my childhood, I would play cricket daily.”
This sentence emphasizes the habitual nature of the activity. It suggests that playing cricket was a regular, repeated action during your childhood.
“I used to play cricket.”
This sentence indicates that playing cricket was something you did in the past, but it doesn’t specify how often. It simply states that it was an activity you engaged in at some point in the past

We would have a family picnic every Sunday VS We used to have a family picnic every Sunday
We would have a family picnic every Sunday.”
This sentence emphasizes the habitual nature of the activity. It suggests that having a family picnic was a regular, repeated action in the past.
“We used to have a family picnic every Sunday.”
This sentence indicates that having a family picnic was something you did regularly in the past, but it doesn’t necessarily emphasize the habitual aspect as strongly as “would.”
In summary, both sentences convey the idea of a past routine, but “would” slightly emphasizes the habitual nature more. You can choose either based on the nuance you want to convey.
